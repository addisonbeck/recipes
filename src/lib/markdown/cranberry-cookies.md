# Flaky Cranberry-Orange-White Chocolate Cookies 

## Ingredients:

- **300g** all-purpose flour
- **1 tsp** baking soda
- **1 1/2 tsp** baking powder
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **1/2 tsp** ground cinnamon (optional)
- **113g** cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- **50g** granulated sugar
- **50g** packed brown sugar
- **1 large egg**
- **1 tbsp** orange zest (about 1 medium orange)
- **1/2 tsp** vanilla extract
- **114g** dried cranberries (or more, to taste)
- **114g** white chocolate chips
- Optional: **15g** heavy cream or milk (if needed for moisture)

## Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven** to 175°C (350°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment
   paper or a silicone mat.
1. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the **300g
   flour**, **1 tsp baking soda**, **1 1/2 tsp baking powder**, **1/2 tsp
   salt**, and **1/2 tsp cinnamon** (if using).
1. **Cut in the butter:** Add the **113g cold butter** to the dry
   ingredients. Use a pastry cutter, fork, or your hands to cut the butter
   into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs, with pea-sized
   butter pieces. Work quickly to keep the butter cold.
1. **Combine the wet ingredients:** In a separate small bowl, whisk together
   the **1 egg**, **50g granulated sugar**, **50g brown sugar**, **1 tbsp
   orange zest**, **30g orange juice**, and **1/2 tsp vanilla extract**. If
   the dough seems too dry, add **15g cream or milk** to help bind it
   together.
1. **Combine wet and dry ingredients:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry
   mixture and gently stir with a spatula until just combined. Be careful not
   to overmix.
1. **Fold in mix-ins:** Gently fold in the **70g dried cranberries** and
   **170g white chocolate chips** until evenly distributed.
1. **Shape the dough:** Scoop the dough into **2-inch (5 cm)** balls, or drop
   spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. If you prefer a
   scone-like shape, you can shape the dough into a rough disk (about **2.5
   cm thick**) and cut it into wedges.
1. **Chill the dough (optional):** For extra flakiness, chill the dough on
   the baking sheet for about **30 minutes** before baking.
1. **Bake the cookies:** Bake for **12–15 minutes**, or until the cookies are
   golden on the edges and lightly browned on top.
1. **Cool and enjoy:** Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few
   minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
