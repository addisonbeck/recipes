## Equipment

* Cast iron pan for shallow frying
* Oven safe dish for browining cheese
* 3 shallow dishes for a frying staion
* A place to rest chicken, like a paper towel lined plate

## Ingredients

* Split bonesless skinless chicken breasts
* Buttermilk, to marinade
* Garlic, for marinade
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Bread crumbs, to coat
* Parmesan cheese, for bread crumb mixture
* 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 2 large eggs
* Red sauce
* 1/2 cup Canola oil
* Fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
* Fresh herbs, optional

## Instructions

1. Add buttermilk, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and chicken to a ziplock bag. Massage and incorporated until all the chicken is coated in the mixture. Press out the air, and seal. Refrigerate for 1-24 hours. 
1. Mix breadcrumbs and parm in a shallow dish for coating. Add a few splashes of buttermilk and incorporate.
1. Place flour in a second shallow dish. 
1. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon of the flour in a third dish.
1. Working one piece of chicken at a time, remove from the bag and add to flour. Turn to coat, shake off excess, and add to egg mixture. Turn to coat, letting excess drip off, and add to bread crumb mixture. Turn to coat, piling crumbs on top and pressing down firmly so a thick layer adheres. Transfer coated chicken to the wire rack and repeat with remaining chicken breasts.
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
1. Heat oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until it registers 375°F. 
1. Working in batches, carefully add chicken by lowering the cutlets away from you into the oil. Add as many cutlets as will fit in one layer without being snug.
1. Cook, swirling pan gently and using a thin flexible metal spatula to loosen chicken if it sticks, until chicken is golden-brown and crisp on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula and a fork, carefully flip chicken and cook until golden brown on second side. Transfer chicken to a paper-towel lined plate to drain and repeat with remaining chicken.
1. Spoon 1/3 of sauce onto the bottom of an oven-safe dish. Shingle chicken pieces on top of sauce. Top with more sauce, forming a line down the center. Combine mozzarella and remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese in a large bowl and toss to coat. Lay cheese mixture over chicken in a straight line down the center.
1. Transfer to the oven and cook until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately grate fresh Parmesan on top. Allow to rest for 3 minutes, top with chopped herbs, and serve immediately on bread or over pasta if desired.
