# Simple Parrafin Wax Candles

> Makes 1lb of candle wax, enough for at least 2, maybe 3 6oz jars

## Ingredients

* 1 pound parrafin wax, cubed
* Liquid dye (optional)
* 1 oz (28 g) of fragrance oil (divided if making multiple fragrances)
* Wicks

## Instructions

### To Prep Wood Wicks

1. If using wood wicks: soak them in oil for 12-24 hours before use to improve burning. Soak twice as many as you need so you can double up wicks.

### To Prep Container

1. Ensure your container is clean and completely dry.
1. Glue (or otherwise attach) any wick holders to the bottom of your container.
1. Insert the wicks into their holders. Use two wood wicks per holder, if using wood wicks.
1. Place the containers in an oven on its lowest setting until ready to use. They should be warm to the touch, but not hot.

### To Melt Wax

1. Bring a few centimeters of water to a soft boil in a suitably sized saucepan.
1. Place the wax into a container, and the container into the saucepan of boiling water.
1. Allow the wax to melt, stirring occasionally. 
1. Remove the container from the saucepan.

### To Color, Fragrance, and Finish

1. Weigh out the correct amount of fragrance oil into a suitable container.
1. When the wax reaches 175-185F (185 preffered but not higher) add 3-4 drops of any color dye. Stir softly until mixed.
1. Pour in your fragrance oil. Stir softly for 2 minutes. Do not over stir, as this can create air bubbles.
1. Slowly pour the wax into its final container, aiming for the center as much as possible while avoiding directly hitting any wicks.
1. Lightly tap the candle on your work surface to avoid any air bubbles from forming.
1. Ensure all wicks are centred and leave the candle to cool for 12-24 hours, open. Ensure they are seperated by about 4 inches, and placed on a wire rack or other heat-sinking surface.
1. To clean your tools: as soon as possible wipe them off with a paper towel and rubbing alcohol.
1. After the initial 12-24 hour rest: trim the wick to about 1/4 of an inch (6mm). Close the container.
1. If at this time you notice your candle has shrunk in a displeasing way: repeat the wax melting and 12-24h rest process with a small amount of wax to fill the gap.
1. Cure the candle for 3-5 days before use :(
