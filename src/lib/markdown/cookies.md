# Cookies

## Chocolate Chip

###  Ingredients

* 2/3 cup (142g) light brown sugar, packed
* 2/3 cup (131g) granulated sugar
* 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup (92g) vegetable shortening
* 3/4 teaspoon salt, (use 1/2 teaspoon salt if you use salted butter)
* 2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract
* 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, optional
* 1 teaspoon cider vinegar or white vinegar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 large egg
* 2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* 2 2/3 cups semisweet chocolate chips*
* 1/2tsp espresso powder optionsl

### Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.
* In a large bowl, combine the sugars, butter, shortening, salt, vanilla and almond extracts, vinegar, espresso powder, and baking soda, beating until smooth and creamy.
* Beat in the egg, again beating until smooth. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a spatula to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.
* Mix in the flour, then the chips.
* Use a spoon (or a tablespoon cookie scoop) to scoop 1 1/4" balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2" between them on all sides; they'll spread.
* For enticing salty-sweet flavor, sprinkle a touch of sea salt atop the cookies before putting them in the oven, if desired.
* Bake the cookies for 11 to 12 minutes, until their edges are chestnut brown and their tops are light golden brown, almost blonde.
* Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool on the pan until they've set enough to move without breaking. Repeat with the remaining dough.
* Store cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days; freeze for longer storage.

## St. Patricks Day Pistachio Cookies

### Ingredients (Yields 32 Tablespoon Cookies)

* 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1/2 cup (99g) granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup (50g) vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup (57g) water
* 1 large egg
* 2 packages (3.4-oz. each) pistachio instant pudding mix, Jell-O brand preferred 
* 1/8 teaspoon pistachio/almond flavor or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* 1/2 to 2/3 cup (71g to 92g) pistachios, chopped

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.
2. Beat the butter, sugar, and vegetable oil in a bowl until combined, then add water and egg, beating until smooth. The mixture will look curdled at first, but will become creamy as you beat.
3. Add the pudding mix, pistachio flavor, salt, and baking powder, beating until smooth; the mixture will turn a lovely pastel green.
4. Stir in the flour and nuts.
5. Drop the dough by the tablespoonful — (a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here) —onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2" between cookies.
6. Flatten the cookies, if desired, using a fork, the flat bottom of a drinking glass, or the end of the pusher from your food processor. If you don't flatten the cookies, they'll bake up in softly flattened mounds; they're lovely either way.
7. Bake the cookies for 15 minutes, until they're starting to brown on the bottom. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pans.
8. Store, well -covered, for up to 5 days. Freeze for up to a month.
