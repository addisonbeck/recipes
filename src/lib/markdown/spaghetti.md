# Spaghetti

## Marcella Hazan Style

> This is more of less the recipe from Marcella Hazan's "Essentials of
> Classic Italian Cooking"

### Ingredients

* 1 chopped onion
* As much garlic as you like
* 1 28oz can of whole tomatoes
* 1 box of spaghetti noodles
* A lot of butter
* A lot of parmesean cheese
* Dried basil or oregano or both
* Red chili flakes
* Put whatever you want to in the sauce it'll be fine. Sometimes I add tomato paste or fish sauce or heavy cream or whatever.

### Instructions

1. To make the sauce: melt some butter in a pan over medium-ish heat.
1. Add the onion and cook until it is soft.
1. Add the garlic and some chili flakes and stire for about 30 seconds.
1. Add your tomatos and smash them up a bit.
1. Let the sauce simmer for as long as you want. I usually let it go for 30 minutes or so. The barest simmer you can get.
1. Blend it up with an immersion blender.
1. Season it and add whatever other stuff you found in your fridge or panty. I always like to add parm, but I add other stuff too.
1. Cook the pasta for a few minutes less than the box says to.
1. Drain the pasta and reserve a ladle full or so of the pasta water.
1. Toss some more butter and the pasta water into your sauce, then add the pasta.
1. Toss the pasta in the sauce with tongs until it is saucy and good.
1. Plate it and garnish with parm and dried basil.

   garlic, and a pinch of salt, making sure to scrape up any meat fond stuck
   to the bottom of the pot. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.

   7-8g/2tsp sugar and bring to a simmer.

   noodles. Simmer for about 60 seconds.

   to the oven to cook, uncovered for 16-18 min, gently stirring and
   submerging at 5 and 10 minutes into cooking.
