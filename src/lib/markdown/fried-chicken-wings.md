## Instructions

1. For the chicken: combine the salt, cornstarch, and baking powder, and salt
   in a large bowl and mix. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Transfer to a
   wire rack and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.
1. For the batter: combine the ingredients in a large bowl and mix. Adjust so
   that the consistency of the batter is like thin paint. The batter should
   fall off the whisk in thin ribbons that instantly disappear as they hit
   the surface of the batter in the bowl.
1. To fry: heat oil in a wok to 350
1. Working in batches toss the chicken in the batter, letting it drip to drop
   any excess. Carefully lower the chicken into the hot oil. Fry for about 8
   minutes while maintaining a temperature of 300 to 325. Transfer to a wire
   rack and add salt.
1. When all the chicken is cooked reheat the oil to 375. Refry the chicken in
   batches. Fry for about 3 minutes while maintaining a temperature of 325
   to 250. Return chicken to the rack to cool.
1. Toss in your sauce and enjoy.
