# Chili ðŸ«˜

## Ingredients

* Assorted dried chili peppers, seeds removed
* Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
* Cocoa powder
* Fine ground coffee
* Brown sugar
* Smokey spices
* Dried herbs
* Other seasonings
* Beef (ground, or whole cut fancy stuff)
* Flavorful sausage (like chorizo)
* Onion, rough chopped
* Bell pepper, rough chopped
* Garlic, minced
* Chicken stock
* Chopped canned tomatoes
* Chili crisp
* Beans
* Potatoes

## Instructions

1. To make a chili puree: Toast the dried chili peppers in a dry & hot dutch
oven, stirring, until lightly charred with a strong smell. This should
take 2-5 minutes. Do not let them smoke. Remove the chili peppers from the
dutch oven and set aside.
1. Cover the chilis with boiling water and hydrate until soft. This could
take 20 - 30 minutes, but may be faster.
1. Add the chilis, a splash of their liquid, a chipotle pepper or two, salt,
pepper, cocoa powder, brown sugar, spices, and herbs to a blender and
blend into a puree. Taste and adjust until you like it. Keep in mind that
aside from salt and some chili crisp this will be seasoning the whole stew.
It should be intensely flavored, pleasantly spicy (maybe even a little too
spicy), and complex.
1. To make the stew: cook the beef in some fat and salt, and set aside
1. Cook the chorizo in the rendered beef fat some salt.
1. Add the onion and bell pepper, and sweat the onion and bell pepper.
1. Add the garlic and cook for a little longer
1. Deglaze the pan with a bit of chicken stock.
1. Add the puree, the chili crisp, the beans, and the potatoes and cover with
enough chicken stock to cook the potatoes.
1. Simmer for 1.5-2 hours, or until done. Taste along the way for salt or any
other adjustments. Using soy sauce for the salt is a good move here.

## Multi-tasking tips

* You can do a lot of this prep work while the dried chili peppers hydrate. Chop
aromatics, cook meat, whatever.

## Make ahead and storage

* Chili will stay good in the fridge for up to 4 days, and can be frozen for
a several months without losing much quality.
