### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Pan:**  
   Line an 8x8-inch or 9x9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper or
   lightly grease it with butter or cooking spray.

2. **Melt the Chocolate and Marshmallow Fluff:**  
   In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk (396 g),
   chocolate chips (340 g), and marshmallow fluff (140 g). Microwave on
   **high** for 30-second intervals, stirring well after each interval. It
   should take about 1.5 to 2 minutes in total to melt everything.

3. **Add Vanilla & Stir:**  
   Once everything is melted and smooth, stir in the vanilla extract (2.5 g)
   and any other optional add-ins like nuts or a pinch of salt.

4. **Pour and Set:**  
   Pour the fudge mixture into your prepared baking dish and spread it out
   evenly with a spatula.

5. **Cool and Set:**  
   Let the fudge cool at room temperature for about 1-2 hours. You can also
   place it in the fridge for 30-60 minutes to speed up the setting process.

6. **Cut and Serve:**  
   Once the fudge has set, cut it into squares and enjoy the smooth, creamy
   texture!
