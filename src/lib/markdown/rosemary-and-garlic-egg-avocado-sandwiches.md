## Ingredients 

* 170g milk
* 240g water, lukewarm
* 6 tablespoons (85g) butter, soft
* 14g salt
* 35g granulated sugar
* 605g Bread Flour
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 2 heads of garlic
* Olive oil + salt for the garlic
* 3 or so avocados
* 5 eggs
* Mayo
* Fresh rosemary

## Instructions

1. To roast the garlic: peel them, cut the tops off, fill with oil and salt, wrap in foil, and roast them in a 400 oven for 25 minutes.
1. Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead.
1. Let rest for about 90 minutes.
1. Lightly grease a Pullman loaf pan. 
1. Gently deflate the dough, transfer it to a lightly greased work surface, shape it into a 13" log, and fit it into the pan. 
1. Cover the pan with the lid
1. Allow the dough to rise until it's just below the lip of the pan, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
1. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.
1. Bake the bread for 25 minutes. 
1. Remove the pan from the oven, carefully remove the lid, and return the bread to the oven to bake for an additional 10 to 20 minutes, or until it tests done; a digital thermometer inserted into the center will register 190°F.
1. Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely.
1. To make the egg salad: hard boil the eggs and mash them together with the
   avocado and mayo. Season with salt and whatever else you would like.
1. Slice the bread and assemble sandwiches
