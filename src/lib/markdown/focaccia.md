# Focaccia

## Ingredients

* 1 cup (120g) Bread Flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast // TODO: Measure this
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (85g) water, lukewarm (100°F)
* 3 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
* 1/2 cup (57g) mozzarella cheese, grated
* 1/4 cup (25g) Parmesan cheese, shredded

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast until well combined. Add the water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the olive oil. Mix until thoroughly combined.  
1. Cover the dough and wait for 15 minutes, then give it a bowl fold: Use a wet hand to grab a section of dough from one side, lift it up, then press it down into the middle. Give the bowl a quarter-turn (90°) and repeat 3 to 6 times, until you’ve circled the dough and it’s become resistant to stretching. 
1. Cover the dough, set aside for another 15 minutes, then perform the bowl fold again. 
1. After the second fold, cover the dough and allow it to rest for about 60 to 90 minutes, until it’s slightly puffy but not necessarily doubled in size. 
1. To shape the dough: Coat the inside of a 9" x 5" or 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan olive oil, being sure to oil up the sides of the pan. Transfer the dough to the pan and turn it once to coat in oil. 
1. Gently press and stretch the dough, using your fingertips to dimple the surface and encourage it to cover the entire pan. (If your dough resists, cover it, let it rest for 30 minutes, and try again.)  
1. Cover the dough and let it rest for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the dough is visibly puffy and has filled the pan. It should rise to about 1 1/2" to 2" below the top of the pan.  
1. In the last 45 minutes of the rise time, preheat the oven to 500°F with a baking stone or steel on the bottom rack. 
1. To bake the focaccia: Bake the focaccia for 8 minutes on the stone, until it turns very lightly golden on top, then carefully remove it from the oven. Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan on top of the dough around the edges first, pressing it up the sides of the pan. Cover the center with a light layer of the remaining cheese. (Concentrating the cheese on the pan’s edges gives you the maximum amount of crispy frico, the cheesy crust.)  
1. Return the focaccia to the oven for 8 to 12 minutes, until the cheese is crispy and golden brown at the edges and melted and bubbling in the center. 
1. Remove the cheesy focaccia from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack. Immediately run a thin knife or offset spatula around the edges of the pan in order to prevent the cheese from cooling and sticking to the sides. Let the cheesy focaccia cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then carefully turn it out onto a wire rack to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing.
