    white of one large egg to the mixture. Double the wine and soy sauce.
    Bring one quart of water to a boil and drop the coated meat into the pot
    one piece at a time. Cook for 30 seconds after the last piece has been
    added, then transfer to a rimmed baking sheet to dry. Proceed with the
    rest of the stir fry as written.

   pink spots on the exterior of the meat. The interior will still be raw.
   Transfer everything to an empty bowl.
