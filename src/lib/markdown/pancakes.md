## Ingredients

### Dry Pancake Mix

* 600g AP flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons sugar

### Pancake Batch

* 4 large eggs, separated
* 680 grams buttermilk
* 450 grams (one 16oz tub) sour cream 
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for serving
* Warm maple syrup

## Directions

### Dry Pancake Mix

* Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous. Transfer to an airtight container. The mix will stay good for 3 months. (See note.)

### Pancake Batch

1. Place one batch of dry mix in a large bowl.
1. Whisk the wet ingredients in a separate bowl, sans butter
1. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking.
1. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).
1. Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). 
1. Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. 
1. Use a 1‚ÅÑ4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. 
1. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. 
1. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.

## Notes

* Pancake dry mix can be scaled up as many times as you'd like. Each batch of pancakes takes 11 ounces of dry mix to make (about 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons). The sour cream can be replaced with more buttermilk. 
* Pancake batter can last in the fridge for 2-4 days before frying
