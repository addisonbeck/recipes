## Smoothie making tips

> You don't need to use ice! It's only really useful if you have many
> unfrozen ingredients. Pre-freeze you smoothie ingredients! Or just buy them
> already frozen!

> Taste before you serve! If it's too thin add some yogurt or a banana. If
> it's too thick add liquid.

> A good rule of thumb ratio is 1/4 cup of liquid for every 1 cup of solids.

> Fiber makes you feel full!

> A basic ratio for making a smoothie is:
> 2–3 parts fruit or vegetables 
>
> 1–1.5 parts liquid 
>
> 1/2 part thickener, like yogurt, nut butter, or chia seeds 

> Your smoothie should always start with one full cup of liquid. For
> fruit-based smoothies, pick two fruits and add one cup of each. If adding
> veggies, use one cup total. Consider kale, spinach, broccoli, arugula, and
> other greens. Another option is to add half a raw beet, which will turn
> your drink a beautiful color. For a colder, thicker smoothie, add a few ice
> cubes.

> Whether you’re allergic or sensitive, the fruit you were planning to use
> went bad, or you just don’t like the taste of something, substitutions are
> a great option. However, keep in mind that you want to substitute foods of
> similar textures, such as using an apple instead of a pear. If you use
> watermelon instead of a pear, the added liquid will change the outcome of
> the smoothie.

From top to bottom the blender should be loaded like this:

```
----- Ice and frozen
----- Fruits and veggies
----- Leafy greens
----- Dry ingredients
----- Liquid
```

> This applies to just about everything you make in your Vitamix, not just
> smoothies. Whether you’re making smoothies, soups, or even thicker blends
> like hummus or sorbet, you’ll almost always get the best results by
> starting the blender on low and quickly ramping up to high. Blending on
> high not only reduces blend time, it also helps keep the motor cool. There
> are a few exceptions, so always follow the recipe instructions–but when in
> doubt, turn it to high.
